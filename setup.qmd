- Make sure you have R and RStudio installed.
- Create an RStudio project in a new directory named `tdvr`.
- Create three directories within `tdvr/`:
  - `data-raw/`.
  - `data-tidy/`
  - `R/`.
  - `plots/`.
- Download the raw data files from
[tdvr.oct.22/data-raw](https://github.com/ramiromagno/tdvr.oct.22/tree/main/data-raw)
to your local folder `data-raw/`.
- From within RStudio, create a new R script file named `data-tidying.R` and
save it to the `R/` folder.

Finally, ensure that you have the following packages installed by running:

``` r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "readxl", "ggbeeswarm"))
```

You can now move on to the next section.
