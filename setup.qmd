1. Make sure you have R and RStudio installed.
2. Create an RStudio project in a new directory named `tdvr`.
3. Download
[data-raw.zip](https://github.com/ramiromagno/tdvr.oct.22/raw/main/data-raw/data-raw.zip)
and unzip it into the directory `tdvr/`. This will create a new directory named `data-raw/` inside `tdvr/`.
4. Create the following directories within `tdvr/`:
    - `data-tidy/`
    - `R/`
    - `plots/`
5. From within RStudio, create a new R script file named `data-tidying.R` and
save it to the `R/` folder.

Finally, ensure that you have the following packages installed by running:

``` r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "readxl", "ggbeeswarm", "patchwork"))
```

You can now move on to the next section Raw Data. You have a link at the bottom
right of this page.
